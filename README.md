# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN (MNIST)

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and achieves high accuracy on unseen test data.

## Objective
To build a deep learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digit images.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
- MNIST handwritten digit dataset
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 testing images
- Image size: 28×28 grayscale

## Model Description
The CNN consists of convolutional layers, max pooling layers, fully connected layers, and a softmax output layer for classification.

## Results
- Test Accuracy: **98.93%**
- Test Loss: **0.032**

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Run the cells sequentially

## Future Scope
- Data augmentation
- Deployment as a web application
- Testing on real handwritten digits
